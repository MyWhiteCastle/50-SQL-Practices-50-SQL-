50道SQL练习题 from [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/flycat296/article/details/63681089)

My anwers are written in MySQL.
I use [paiza.io](https://paiza.io/projects/3nUaEHloK-KS_FiFqr7u9g?language=mysql) for practicing online.

I first insert all tables as instructed in [知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32137597). 
Notice that there are a lot of wrong answers in that post, and therefore I only used the instruction for table insertion.

All answers are in [SQL_50_Answers](SQL_50_Answers.md)
Anyone is welcomed to discuss the solutions with me or any wrong answers.
